# push_swap_evaluator

## Description
This is a simple push swap tester. \
All you need is a repository with a Makefile that compiles a *push_swap* executable. \
What you should do is clone this repository inside your push_swap root directory. \
Inside this repository (push_swap_evaluator), you run `./evaluator.py`. \
The test is written in Python, and we tried to make it easy to know what is being tested. \
Enjoy!
