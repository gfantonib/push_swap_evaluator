# push_swap_evaluator

## Description
This is a simple push swap tester.
All you need to do is clone this repository inside your push_swap root directory.  
You need also a repository with a Makefile that compiles a *push_swap* executable.
Inside this repository, you run `./evaluator.py`.  
The test is written in Python, and we tried to make it easy to know what is being tested.  
Enjoy!
